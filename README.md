<em>Clothing management made easy.</em>

___
Managing a wardrobe is not as easy as it looks. Besides making sure you have enough clothes of each type (and appropriate for the current season), you must in theory choose one outfit every day (at least), making sure each garment looks nice with the rest.

Vestis (latin for clothing) is an attempt to mitigate this tasks. Although it is currently being developed, it will ideally provide the following functionality:

### Clothing management
Allow the users to see all the clothes they currently own, add or remove clothes when they buy or discard them, and see purchase recommendations.

For example, things like:

* "Winter is coming, and your newest coat is already two years old. Maybe you'd like to buy a new one?"
* "You only have two t-shirts in your wardrobe. You should buy some more to add variety to your outfits."

### Outfit creation
Select the types of clothes that you want, and Vestis will generate a combination of clothing items that look good on you. Users will likely be able to mark certain clothes as favorites, and those will be picked more often.

Vestis will even look at the weather forecast and suggest types of clothes that fit the temperature (including a suggestion to take an umbrella if it's going to rain).

### Multiple users

The app will support more than one user profile, so multiple family members or housemates can use it. Every user will have a separate clothing list, so the system doesn't suggest wearing someone else's clothes.

## System requirements

So far, the requirements are as follows:

* Windows 10, update 1903.
